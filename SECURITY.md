## Reporting a Vulnerability

I am greatly thanking you if you have found the vulnerability in this repo and reporting to me.
That would means a lot for me, because I build this for everyone who wants to try/use it.

You can mail me at geneshsarretsarretret@gmail.com subjecting `gensart-ai/whatsapp-bot - Vulnerability Issue`
and describe the vulnerabilities you've found.  
  
Again, I am thanking you for that.
