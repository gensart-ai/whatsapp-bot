# Overview
> This application uses `whatsapp-web.js` as a primary library. Keep in mind if you want to use this app, you did already know that **WhatsApp terms & conditions do not allow any bots or automation** on its services. So, I do not responsible for any banning happen to your WhatsApp account by using this app. <b>I strongly suggested</b> you to use this app with your WhatsApp backup number. I use my second number for this and still safe until now.

Current Stable Version : `1.1.0`  
Look at the sidebar for more docs.
