!> This application uses `whatsapp-web.js` as a primary library. Keep in mind if you want to use this app, you did already know that **WhatsApp terms & conditions do not allow any bots or automation** on its services. Make sure you use this app with your WhatsApp backup number to prevent banning to your primary WhatsApp account. I use my second number for this and still safe until now.

Current Stable Version : `1.0`  
Look at the sidebar for more docs.  
(Can't see the sidebar on mobile ? The button is on your bottom left screen :))

And it's done.
