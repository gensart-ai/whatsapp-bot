# Requirements
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)  
This project requires **Node.js** to run, I use **Node v20.10** on Windows 10 and **Debian 11** too and it works fine. I haven't tested it yet on different version or environment than mine, but you may try it and report it to me, so I can update this details by you :).

Oh also, make sure you have installed **NPM** too. Usually **Node.js** includes **NPM** so you don't need to install it again.

**ðŸ”´ IMPORTANT NOTICE ðŸ”´**  
This project greatly having use of [whatsapp-web.js](https://wwebjs.dev/),  and maybe **if you are running on a `no-gui` Linux image (Server, or Linux OS that do not installed GUI system)**, you may need to see and follow this page first : [Click Me](https://wwebjs.dev/guide/#installation-on-no-gui-systems)

# Configurations
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)  
As the current version, I put some global configurations on a Typescript file in : `./src/env.ts`. You can change the bot name, imgBb keys, etc.

For `imgBBKey`, you can retrieve the key from [here](https://api.imgbb.com/), but you may need to sign up first if you didn't have any ImgBB account before.

# Quickstart

If you have done the [Installation](#installation) and have checked the [Configurations](#configurations), you can open the terminal at root directory of the project and do the command below to build the `src` to JavaScript to `dist`:
```bash
npm run build
```
After that, you can run the project using this command :
```bash
npm run serve
```
If you succeed, you should see some message like this :
![WhatsApp QR Code shown on terminal](https://i.ibb.co/K5rzdxp/readme-quickstart-1.png)
The terminal will shows a QR Code to be scanned with your WhatsApp app (doing it like scanning for WhatsApp Web). And if project succeed the QR, it will output :
