# Requirements  

## TL;DR  <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
You need :
- Node.js v18++
- NPM installed on your device
- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) (Windows users may need this) - For multimedia support

## Long to short <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
This project requires **Node.js** to run, I use **Node v20.10** on Windows 10 and **Debian 11** too and it works fine. I haven't tested it yet on different version or environment than mine, but you may try it and report it to me, so I can update this details by you :).  
You can use this [link](https://nodejs.org/en) to go to Node.js homepage for installation or more details.  

Oh also, make sure you have installed **NPM** too. Usually **Node.js** includes **NPM** so you don't need to install it again.  

And i often experience errors when testing multimedia with this app on Windows 10 environment, but not on Debian 11. My assumption going to **ffmpeg** problem, maybe you can install that if you experience an error when dealing with multimedia thing.
